## Government Agencies and Law Enforcement

Government Agencies and Law enforcement agencies may request that we share information with them, and we want to balance user privacy and government requests.

When we receive a request from a Government Agency to share data, we will carefully review the request to ensure it follows the laws of all applicable jurisdictions. Additionally, we will only provide the information necessary to comply and only if it is not a privacy risk.

If we believe that we can prevent or reduce the risk of harm by sharing information with Government Agencies, we may share information with those agencies. We still review these requests to make sure they comply with our policies and applicable laws.

If we get a request from a Government Agency regarding you, we will notify you as soon as possible unless legally prohibited. We will not notify you if a request is related to an emergency until after the emergency has passed.
