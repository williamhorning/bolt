# Commands

The prefix for all of these commands are `!bolt`. You may also be able to use
Discord slash commands or other platform-specific ways of running commands. If
there are square brackets around text that means that's an optional parameter
you can pass to that command. If there're surrounded by angle brackets that
means that parameter is required by that command.
