# Dashboard website

Bolt has a dashboard / documentation site that you should configure for your own
instance.

## Cloudflare Pages

Cloudflare Pages is the way the official dashboard is hosted. To set it up, set
your root directory to `./packages/bolt-dash`, build command to `./mksite.sh`
and your output directory to `./output`.
