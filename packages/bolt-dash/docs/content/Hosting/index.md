Bolt is a chat bot that's pretty easy to run on your own server if you want to.
To get started, take a look at one of the following options:

- [Docker (recommended)](./docker.md)
- [Deno](./deno.md)

After you've set up an instance of Bolt, take a look at these pages:

- [Configuring Bolt](./configure.md)
- [DB Migrations](./database.md)
